## BeDone

Imagine the world where tasks are easy to complete and track.

## Future Considerations
- `ThemeProvider` vs `Theme`. Okay for now, cleaner code is more advantageuos rather than too much providers that might affect performance or have negative impact on other providers
- colors needs more contrast
- we can make use of `useRef` and `useCallback` for a better optimization on reference objects. optional given the scale of the app
- `@expo/vector-icons` is [built](https://docs.expo.dev/guides/icons/#expovector-icons) on top of `react-native-vector-icons`
